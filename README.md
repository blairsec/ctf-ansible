# ctfjs-ansible

This repository contains ansible playbooks for running a CTF competition with [ctfjs](https://github.com/blairsec/ctfjs). All files ending in `.example` or `.example.yml` will need to be copied into a file without the ".example" and edited.

Additionally, `frontend.yml` contains hardcoded S3 bucket and Cloudfront distribution IDs, so those need to be edited as well.
